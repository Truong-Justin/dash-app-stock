# Python Stock Dashboard


## Project Description
This web application was made using Python and the Dash framework. OHLC (Open/High/Low/Close) values are obtained using the yfinance API that interfaces with the Yahoo Finance! website. This project was intended to display relevant stock information to a user, without requiring the user to go through a complicated setup process. When the web application is accessed by the user, they have access to: common standard-moving-averages, resistance/support levels that are derived using a fractal-based algorithm or a fibonacci-based algorithm depending on the selected timeframe.

1. The first option is to visit the deployed web application via stockdash.justintruong.studio
    - This is the easiest option

2. The second option involves installing the application onto a local machine

    - Then, navigate to folder using the terminal/console where the repository was saved to and install the dependencies within the requirements.txt file 
      - To install dependencies, type $ pip install -r requirements.txt without the $

    - Run the program either via the terminal/console by typing python3 app.py or by running the program within your preferred IDE that supports Python.
